# LDO Door
This directory contains STL files for an alternative door mounting design.

## Screw Hinge
The screw hinge uses M3 screws instead of a print in place hinge design. We recommend using three hinges per door. M3x40 SHCS screws are recommended, however M3x30 or Mx35 screws also work. 

## Handles
These handles are of the same design as the original voron door handles but longer. handle_a and handle_b are simply mirrors of each other. handle_b_nameplate contains a recess to embed an LDO kit number nameplate (use superglue to attach the nameplate).
