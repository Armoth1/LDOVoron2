# STLs for LDO Kit
This directory contains STL files specific to the LDO kit.

## Plug Panel 1.2mm
This part replaces the `plug_panel` part from the official [Voron repo](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2/tree/Voron2.4/STLs/VORON2.4/Electronics_Compartment/Plug_Panel). This part adapts specifically to 1.2mm AC inlets for a better fit.

## Nozzle Probe LDO
This part replaces the `nozzle_probe` part from the official [Voron repo](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2/tree/Voron2.4/STLs/VORON2.4/Z_Endstop). This part allows for an LDO Z Endstop PCB to be used.

## Handlebar Spacer
This optional part offsets the top panel thickness and helps mount the included aluminium handle bar.

## Z Rail stop
An optional part that stops the linear rail carts from falling off the Z rails.

## Exhaust Cover
If you decide to build the Nevermore internal circulation filter, print this exhaust cover to seal the back panel.

## LED PCB Spacer
This part helps mount the LED splitter PCB to the 2020 extrusion.

## Toolhead Breakout PCB Bracket
This part helps mount the toolhead breakout PCB. Print an additional DIN rail clip to attach to this part.

## LDO Bestagon Insert
An (optional) LDO Logo that inserts into the hexagonal holes of the skirts.

## Beefy Raspberry Pi Mount
This mount uses two DIN clips for a more secure grip on DIN rails. 

## Z Belt Cover A LED
This is a remix of the original Z Belt Cover but leaves a small opening for the LED cable to pass through.
