# STLs for LDO Kit
This directory contains STL files specific to the LDO kit.

## Plug Panel 1.2mm
This part replaces the `plug_panel` part from the official [Voron repo](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2/tree/Voron2.4/STLs/VORON2.4/Electronics_Compartment/Plug_Panel). This part adapts specifically to 1.2mm AC inlets for a better fit.

## Nozzle Probe LDO
This part replaces the `nozzle_probe` part from the official [Voron repo](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2/tree/Voron2.4/STLs/VORON2.4/Z_Endstop). This part allows for an LDO Z Endstop PCB to be used.

## Handlebar Spacer
This optional part offsets the top panel thickness and helps mount the included aluminium handle bar.

## Z Rail stop
An optional part that stops the linear rail carts from falling off the Z rails.
